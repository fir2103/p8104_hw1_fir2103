Problem 1

```{r}
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")
```

Exploring the data

```{r}
names(penguins)
nrow(penguins)
ncol(penguins)
mean(penguins$flipper_length_mm, na.rm=TRUE)
```

The dataset has 344 rows and 8 columns. The variables are species of the penguins, the island they're located, the length of their bill and flipper, depth of their bill (all in mm), body mass (in grams), sex and the study year (2007, 2008 or 2009). There are three species represented (Ad√©lie, Chinstrap and Gentoo), three islands (Biscoe, Dream and Torgersen). 

The mean flipper length is 200.9 mm.

  geom_point(aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=flipper_length_mm, color=species))
